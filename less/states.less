/*
    A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles.
    For example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or expanded state.
    A message may be in a success or error state.
    States are generally applied to the same element as a layout rule or applied 
    to the same element as a base module class.
    State styles can apply to layout and/or module styles; and
    State styles indicate a JavaScript dependency.
